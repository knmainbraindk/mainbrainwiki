## "Insert Date String" extension for VS Code

Available at [VS Code Market Place](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsynowiec.vscode-insertdatestring)

Pressing ```Cmd + Shift + I``` on Mac will insert the formatted DateTime string into the editor window itself.
This does *not* work using the VS Code Explorer window, ie. when first naming files and folders.
To use with folders first insert string into a file, copy the string and use for a regular rename folder operation.
